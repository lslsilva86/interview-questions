<summary>1. What are Micro-Frontends, and how do they differ from a monolithic front-end architecture?</summary>

Micro-Frontends is an architectural style where a single front-end application is decomposed into smaller, independently developed, tested, and deployed front-end units. Each unit, or Micro-Frontend, represents a piece of functionality owned by a separate team.

**Key differences:**

- **Development:** In a monolith, the codebase is shared among all developers; in Micro-Frontends, teams work in isolated codebases.
- **Deployment:** Monoliths require full deployment for changes, whereas Micro-Frontends allow independent deployment.
- **Ownership:** Micro-Frontends enable team autonomy by allowing teams to own specific features end-to-end.

</br>

<details>

<summary>2. What are the primary benefits and challenges of implementing Micro-Frontends in large-scale projects?</summary>

**Benefits:**

- Independent development and deployment.
- Technology agnostic (teams can use different frameworks/libraries).
- Better scalability with small, focused teams.
- Fault isolation (a failure in one Micro-Frontend doesn’t crash the entire app).

**Challenges:**

- Increased complexity in integration, communication, and routing.
- Managing shared dependencies and avoiding duplication.
- Higher initial setup cost for infrastructure and tooling.
- Maintaining consistent design and user experience across teams.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>3. Explain how Micro-Frontends align with the principles of Microservices. How do they differ in terms of implementation?</summary>

**Alignment:**

- **Independence:** Both allow teams to develop and deploy independently.
- **Decentralization:** Ownership is decentralized, allowing focused development.
- **Scalability:** Both improve scalability by dividing responsibilities.

**Differences:**

- **Granularity:** Microservices deal with backend logic, while Micro-Frontends are concerned with UI.
- **Communication:** Microservices use APIs for communication, whereas Micro-Frontends require DOM-based communication or pub/sub systems.
- **Framework Diversity:** Microservices easily use different tech stacks, while mixing frameworks in Micro-Frontends is harder due to client-side limitations.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>4. What approaches can be used to share state between Micro-Frontends without tightly coupling them?</summary>

**Approaches:**
