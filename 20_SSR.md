<summary>1. Explain the key differences between Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Client-Side Rendering (CSR), and Static Site Generation (SSG).</summary>

- **SSR**: The HTML is generated on the server for every request. It ensures content is available before the page loads, improving SEO and perceived performance for content-heavy pages.
- **CSR**: The server sends a barebones HTML file with a JavaScript bundle. Content is rendered dynamically on the client-side, which can lead to slower initial page load and SEO challenges.
- **SSG**: HTML is pre-rendered at build time. It serves static files for fast page loads and scalability, but isn’t suitable for frequently changing content without additional mechanisms like ISR.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>2. In which scenarios would SSR be a better choice over CSR or SSG, and why?</summary>

- **SSR** is ideal for:
  - Dynamic pages that need fresh data for every request, like user dashboards or real-time news.
  - SEO-critical pages where content must be immediately available to search engines.
  - Personalization scenarios (e.g., localized content or user-specific data).
  - Applications requiring fast initial load for time-sensitive data.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>3. Describe how SSR improves SEO and what limitations might still exist despite using SSR.</summary>

- **SEO Benefits**:

  - Search engines receive fully-rendered HTML, ensuring crawlers index meaningful content.
  - Ensures meta tags (e.g., title, description) are present immediately, crucial for search rankings.

- **Limitations**:
  - Poorly configured SSR apps can have slow load times, which negatively impacts SEO.
  - Content behind authentication may still not be crawlable.
  - Non-standard JavaScript or misconfigured hydration can cause SEO issues.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>4. How does SSR impact the Time to First Byte (TTFB), and how would you optimize SSR performance?</summary>

- **Impact**: SSR increases TTFB because the server needs time to render the HTML for every request.
- **Optimization Strategies**:
  - Cache rendered pages or fragments on the server.
  - Optimize server performance with faster backend logic and database queries.
  - Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache dynamic content when possible.
  - Use lazy loading for non-essential assets and components.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>5. What are the major trade-offs of SSR in terms of server load and scalability, and how would you mitigate them?</summary>

- **Trade-offs**:

  - Higher server load due to rendering for every request.
  - Scalability challenges as traffic increases, requiring more infrastructure.
  - Slower responses under heavy loads.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Use caching (e.g., HTTP caching, CDN, or in-memory cache).
  - Employ load balancing and autoscaling infrastructure.
  - Optimize rendering logic and use techniques like memoization to reduce redundant processing.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>6. How does SSR affect caching strategies compared to CSR or SSG?</summary>

- SSR requires more dynamic caching strategies:
  - Cache responses at the CDN or server layer with appropriate headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`).
  - Use a hybrid caching strategy, where only specific sections (e.g., headers, footers) are cached while others remain dynamic.
  - For personalized content, consider using edge computing to cache partial results.

In contrast:

- CSR caches primarily API responses.
- SSG relies heavily on static file caching with a CDN.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>7. How would you handle API latency or failures when rendering a page on the server in an SSR setup?</summary>

- Use **timeouts** to limit API request delays.
- Implement **graceful degradation**: Show fallback content or skeleton loaders if the API fails.
- Log errors for debugging and monitor APIs with tools like New Relic or Sentry.
- Utilize **circuit breakers** to prevent the server from waiting indefinitely.
- Cache previous API responses for critical sections to serve stale content if the API fails.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>8. What challenges can arise with authentication and session management in an SSR architecture?</summary>

- **Challenges**:
  - Managing user sessions securely across requests, especially with tokens.
  - Preventing sensitive data leakage in the HTML sent to the client.
  - Maintaining session consistency when scaling across multiple servers.
- **Solutions**:
  - Use HTTP-only cookies for storing tokens to improve security.
  - Validate tokens server-side for each request.
  - Leverage encrypted storage for sensitive session data.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>9. How would you debug issues like hydration errors in SSR applications?</summary>

- **Steps to Debug**:
  - Check for mismatches between server-rendered HTML and client-side React state.
  - Look for JavaScript errors or warnings in the browser console.
  - Ensure that client-side logic matches the server’s output exactly (e.g., avoid random values in `id` or `key` attributes during rendering).
  - Disable JavaScript and inspect the rendered HTML to identify discrepancies.
  - Use React DevTools and Next.js debugging tools to analyze hydration steps.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>10. What metrics or performance indicators would you monitor to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR?</summary>

- **Key Metrics**:

  - **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Measures server response time.
  - **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Indicates how quickly the user sees the first visual element.
  - **Server response time**: Measures how long the server takes to render HTML.
  - **Page Load Time**: Measures overall page performance.
  - **SEO metrics**: Indexing status, ranking, and crawl errors.
  - **Error rates**: Monitors failed requests or rendering errors.

- Use tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and APM tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) to track these metrics.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>11. Explain the difference between `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` in Next.js.</summary>

- **`getServerSideProps`**:
  - Runs on every request and fetches data on the server-side.
  - Suitable for pages with dynamic data that changes frequently.
  - Results in slower page load due to server-side rendering on each request.
- **`getStaticProps`**:
  - Fetches data at build time and generates static HTML.
  - Ideal for pages with data that doesn't change often or can be updated periodically.
  - Enables faster page loads as pre-rendered HTML is served.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>12. How would you dynamically generate paths for a page in Next.js when using `getStaticPaths`?</summary>

- Use the `getStaticPaths` function to pre-generate a list of paths based on your data:

  ```javascript
  export async function getStaticPaths() {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/items");
    const items = await res.json();

    const paths = items.map((item) => ({
      params: { id: item.id.toString() },
    }));

    return { paths, fallback: false };
  }
  ```

- This function defines which paths to pre-render at build time.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>13. What is ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), and how does it enhance SSG in Next.js?</summary>

- **ISR** allows you to update static pages after the site is built, without rebuilding the entire application.
- You specify a `revalidate` period in `getStaticProps` to regenerate the page:

  ```javascript
  export async function getStaticProps() {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await res.json();

    return {
      props: { data },
      revalidate: 60, // Regenerate every 60 seconds
    };
  }
  ```

- **Benefits**:
  - Combines the speed of static pages with the flexibility of dynamic content updates.
  - Reduces server load compared to SSR.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>14. How would you handle scenarios where some data for a page needs to be fetched on the server (SSR) and other data can be fetched on the client (CSR)?</summary>

- Use `getServerSideProps` for server-side data fetching and fetch additional data client-side in a React `useEffect` hook.

  ```javascript
  export async function getServerSideProps() {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/server-data");
    const serverData = await res.json();

    return { props: { serverData } };
  }

  function Page({ serverData }) {
    const [clientData, setClientData] = React.useState(null);

    React.useEffect(() => {
      fetch("https://api.example.com/client-data")
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => setClientData(data));
    }, []);

    return (
      <>
        <div>Server Data: {serverData}</div>
        <div>Client Data: {clientData}</div>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>15. Can you use SSR and SSG together for a single Next.js application? Provide an example.</summary>

- Yes, you can use SSR for some pages and SSG for others by choosing the appropriate data-fetching function (`getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`) per page.
  - Example:
    - `/home`: Use `getStaticProps` for static content.
    - `/dashboard`: Use `getServerSideProps` for dynamic, user-specific content.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>16. How would you implement a fallback for static pages using `getStaticPaths`?</summary>

- Use the `fallback` option in `getStaticPaths`:

  ```javascript
  export async function getStaticPaths() {
    return {
      paths: [{ params: { id: "1" } }],
      fallback: true, // Serve a fallback page while data is fetched
    };
  }

  export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
    const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/item/${params.id}`);
    const data = await res.json();

    return { props: { data } };
  }
  ```

- A fallback page (e.g., loading spinner) is displayed until the new static page is generated.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>17. How do you handle global state in a Next.js application that uses SSR?</summary>

- Use a state management library like `Redux` or `Recoil`.
- Pass server-side data as initial state:

  ```javascript
  export async function getServerSideProps() {
    const data = await fetchData();

    return {
      props: {
        initialState: { key: data },
      },
    };
  }

  function Page({ initialState }) {
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
    return <div>{state.key}</div>;
  }
  ```

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>18. What is the role of `Recoil` or `Redux` in an SSR setup, and how would you avoid hydration mismatches when using these state management tools?</summary>

- **Role**:

  - `Recoil` or `Redux` helps manage global state across components.
  - Allows sharing server-side data between components without prop drilling.

- **Avoiding Hydration Mismatches**:
  - Ensure initial state on the server matches the client’s state.
  - Use serialization/deserialization methods to handle non-serializable data.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>19. How can you leverage caching headers in a Next.js SSR app to improve performance?</summary>

- Set caching headers in the response object from the server:
  ```javascript
  export async function getServerSideProps({ res }) {
    res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=30");
    return { props: { data: "cached data" } };
  }
  ```

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>20. How does Next.js manage the cache for revalidated pages in ISR?</summary>

- ISR stores cached pages on the server and updates them based on the `revalidate` period.
- New requests trigger revalidation if the period has expired.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>21. Explain the impact of CDN integration with a Next.js SSR setup.</summary>

- **Benefits**:
  - CDNs cache static assets and reduce server load.
  - Serve cached responses for SSR pages with proper caching headers.
- **Challenges**:
  - Dynamic SSR pages may not benefit as much unless partial caching is used.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>22. How would you prevent sensitive server-side data from being exposed to the client in a Next.js SSR application?</summary>

- Only pass non-sensitive data via `props` in `getServerSideProps`.
- Use secure storage (e.g., environment variables) for sensitive keys.
- Validate all inputs and sanitize responses.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>23. How do you handle meta tag management for dynamic pages in a Next.js SSR application to ensure optimal SEO performance?</summary>

- Use the `next/head` component to dynamically set meta tags:

  ```javascript
  import Head from "next/head";

  export default function Page({ title, description }) {
    return (
      <>
        <Head>
          <title>{title}</title>
          <meta name="description" content={description} />
        </Head>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>24. If you were building an e-commerce application, which pages would you render using SSR, which ones would you use SSG for, and why?</summary>

- **SSR**:

  - Cart and checkout (dynamic, user-specific data).
  - Personalized recommendations.

- **SSG**:
  - Product pages (static data, infrequent updates).
  - Category pages for better scalability.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>25. Explain how you would implement multi-language support in a Next.js application with SSR.</summary>

- Use Next.js’ `next-i18next` or a similar library.
- Fetch localized content in `getServerSideProps` based on user’s locale.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>26. How would you migrate a CSR-heavy React application to Next.js using SSR/SSG?</summary>

- Gradually replace React components with Next.js pages.
- Start with SSG for static pages.
- Use SSR for pages requiring dynamic data.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>27. You are tasked to optimize the performance of an SSR page in a Next.js app. What strategies would you use?</summary>

- Cache rendered HTML.
- Optimize database queries and backend logic.
- Use lazy loading for non-critical components.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>28. Write the implementation of a Next.js page that dynamically fetches and renders data using `getServerSideProps`.</summary>

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  const data = await res.json();
  return { props: { data } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
```

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>29. A Next.js app using SSR is encountering "hydration failed" errors. How would you identify and fix these errors?</summary>

- Check server-rendered HTML matches client-side output.
- Avoid using random values during rendering.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>30. In a Next.js app, describe how you would configure a fallback mechanism for `getStaticProps`.</summary>

- Use the `fallback: true` option in `getStaticPaths`.
- Display a loading spinner while the page is being generated.

</details>

</br>

<details>

<summary>31. Explain the impact of SSR on third-party analytics libraries, and how to ensure accurate tracking.</summary>

- Analytics tools may struggle with dynamic pages.
- Ensure page views are logged manually after SSR.
