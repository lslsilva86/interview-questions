<summary>1. How does React Query ensure that server state stays in sync with the server? What mechanisms does it use to handle stale or outdated data?</summary>

React Query ensures server state stays in sync by leveraging the following mechanisms:

- **Stale-Time Configuration**: Determines how long data is considered fresh before becoming stale. While data is fresh, it won’t be refetched unless explicitly triggered.
- **Background Refetching**: Automatically refetches data in the background when queries become stale, components are re-rendered, or the user focuses back on the window.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Queries can be invalidated manually (e.g., using `queryClient.invalidateQueries`) or programmatically after mutations to ensure fresh data is fetched.
- **Dependency Tracking**: Uses `queryKey` as a unique identifier to track and refetch only the data relevant to a query.

<summary>2. Explain how React Query's `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks differ in managing server state. When would you use each?</summary>

- **`useQuery`**:

  - Used for **fetching** and **caching** data.
  - Automatically handles background updates, stale data, and error retries.
  - Use cases: Fetching lists, single resources, or paginated data.

- **`useMutation`**:
  - Used for **modifying server-side data** (e.g., create, update, delete).
  - Focuses on side effects, like triggering a refetch or invalidating specific queries after a successful mutation.
  - Supports optimistic updates for a responsive UI.

**When to use each**:

- Use `useQuery` when retrieving data from the server.
- Use `useMutation` for POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE operations.

</details>  
</br>

<details>

<summary>3. How does React Query handle background refetching? Can you configure the intervals or triggers for refetching? Provide examples.</summary>

React Query handles background refetching by automatically updating stale data under various triggers. Refetching occurs when:

- The query becomes stale (based on the `staleTime` setting).
- The component that uses the query is remounted.
- The browser window regains focus or network reconnects (`refetchOnWindowFocus` and `refetchOnReconnect` settings).
- A manual call to `refetch()` is triggered.

**Configuration**:
You can customize background refetching using options like:

- `refetchInterval`: Specifies the interval for periodic refetching.
- `staleTime`: Determines how long data is considered fresh.
- `refetchOnWindowFocus`: Enables/disables refetching when the window gains focus.

**Example**:

```javascript
const { data, refetch } = useQuery("todos", fetchTodos, {
  staleTime: 10000, // 10 seconds
  refetchOnWindowFocus: true, // Refetch on focus
  refetchInterval: 30000, // Refetch every 30 seconds
});
```

<summary>4. What strategies does React Query use for cache invalidation? How would you implement cache invalidation for dependent queries?</summary>

React Query uses the following strategies for cache invalidation:

- **Query Key Invalidation**: Invalidate queries by their `queryKey` using `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`.
- **Mutation Side Effects**: Automatically refetch related queries after mutations using the `onSuccess` or `onSettled` callbacks.
- **Time-Based Expiry**: Data is invalidated automatically when it becomes stale, based on the `staleTime` setting.
- **Manual Invalidation**: Developers can manually invalidate specific queries or groups of queries.

**Dependent Queries**:
To invalidate dependent queries:

- Ensure they use unique and well-structured `queryKey`s.
- Use `queryClient.invalidateQueries` with partial matching:
  ```javascript
  queryClient.invalidateQueries(["todos", "user", userId]);
  ```

</details>  
</br>

<details>

<summary>5. Explain the difference between the concepts of "stale" data and "inactive" queries in React Query. How do they affect the cache behavior?</summary>

- **Stale Data**:

  - Data becomes stale when it has exceeded the `staleTime` configured for the query. Stale data can still be used, but it triggers a background refetch.
  - Stale queries remain in the cache and are ready to be used by components.

- **Inactive Queries**:
  - Queries are inactive when no components are subscribed to them. These queries can still reside in the cache but are not actively updated.
  - They are removed from memory based on the `cacheTime` configuration.

**Effects on Cache Behavior**:

- Stale data ensures the user always has access to somewhat fresh data while allowing background refetching for updates.
- Inactive queries help optimize memory usage by discarding unused queries after the `cacheTime` expires.

</details>  
</br>

<details>

<summary>6. Describe the purpose of the `queryClient` in React Query. How would you use it to prefetch, invalidate, or reset queries?</summary>

The `queryClient` is the core object in React Query that manages the cache, handles query invalidation, and provides methods to manipulate queries globally.

**Key Use Cases**:

- **Prefetching**:

  ```javascript
  queryClient.prefetchQuery("todos", fetchTodos);
  ```

  Fetches and caches data ahead of time.

- **Invalidating**:

  ```javascript
  queryClient.invalidateQueries("todos");
  ```

  Marks queries as stale and triggers background refetching.

- **Resetting**:

  ```javascript
  queryClient.resetQueries("todos");
  ```

  Clears data for specific queries and optionally refetches.

- **Fetching Directly**:
  ```javascript
  queryClient.fetchQuery("todos", fetchTodos);
  ```
  Fetches data without relying on existing cache.

<summary>7. What is the significance of the `queryKey` in React Query? How do you design an effective `queryKey` strategy for complex applications?</summary>

The `queryKey` is a unique identifier for queries in React Query. It allows the library to cache, track, and refetch specific queries efficiently.

**Significance**:

- Differentiates queries fetching similar data.
- Enables partial invalidation of related queries.
- Serves as the dependency for query updates and re-fetches.

**Effective Design Strategy**:

1. **Use Descriptive Keys**:
   - Make `queryKey`s clear and structured, e.g., `['todos', 'user', userId]`.
2. **Hierarchical Structure**:

   - Break down keys for nested or dependent data, enabling partial invalidation.

3. **Consistency**:

   - Use consistent key formats throughout the application.

4. **Dynamic Parameters**:

   - Include dynamic values (e.g., `userId` or `pageNumber`) for specific queries.

5. **Avoid Overloading Keys**:
   - Do not use overly generic keys like `'data'`, as this increases the risk of collisions.

**Example**:

```javascript
const { data } = useQuery(["todos", "user", userId], fetchUserTodos);
```

<summary>8. Compare React Query and Redux for managing server state. When would you choose React Query over Redux, and vice versa?</summary>

**React Query**:

- Focuses on **server state management** (e.g., data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server).
- Provides built-in mechanisms for background refetching, retries, and stale data handling.
- Reduces boilerplate with declarative APIs (`useQuery`, `useMutation`).

**Redux**:

- Manages **global client-side state** but can handle server state with middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.
- Requires manual implementation of caching, refetching, and error handling.
- Offers fine-grained control over state transitions with custom reducers and actions.

**When to Choose**:

- **React Query**: For applications with frequent server interactions and a need for caching or automated data fetching.
- **Redux**: For applications with complex client-side state or scenarios requiring tight control over state updates and persistence.

</details>  
</br>

<details>

<summary>9. What are the key differences between caching in React Query and state persistence in Redux? How does React Query's approach reduce boilerplate compared to Redux?</summary>

**Caching in React Query**:

- Automatically stores fetched data and invalidates it when stale.
- Provides background updates, deduplication of requests, and automatic retries.
- Requires minimal configuration through `useQuery` hooks.

**State Persistence in Redux**:

- State persistence must be implemented manually or with libraries like Redux Persist.
- Middleware is often needed to manage asynchronous operations.
- Developers must write actions, reducers, and middleware, leading to more boilerplate.

**Reduction in Boilerplate**:

- React Query abstracts caching, refetching, and synchronization logic, eliminating the need for custom reducers or middleware for server state.

<details>

<summary>10. Redux is often considered a "single source of truth." How does React Query challenge this concept in terms of managing server state?</summary>

React Query challenges the "single source of truth" concept by:

- Treating the **server** as the source of truth for server state, fetching and caching data only as needed.
- Keeping the local cache **ephemeral**, ensuring it stays in sync with the server rather than persisting indefinitely.
- Offloading server-state-specific responsibilities (e.g., retries, invalidation, and background updates) to the query library.

In contrast, Redux treats all state—whether client or server—as part of the global store, requiring explicit synchronization.

</details>  
</br>

<details>

<summary>11. How does React Query handle scenarios like pagination and infinite scrolling compared to Redux? Which approach would you recommend for such use cases?</summary>

**React Query**:

- Handles pagination and infinite scrolling with features like `useInfiniteQuery`:
  - Automatically fetches the next page of data when triggered.
  - Provides utilities for managing loading, error states, and appending new data.

**Redux**:

- Requires developers to manually implement logic for maintaining paginated data (e.g., appending or replacing data).
- Middleware or custom reducers are often needed.

**Recommendation**:

- **React Query**: Ideal for simple and efficient handling of paginated or infinite scrolling use cases.
- **Redux**: Use if you need tight control over how pages are stored or manipulated in the state.

<details>

<summary>12. Can you highlight the performance benefits of using React Query's caching mechanism over Redux when dealing with frequent data updates?</summary>

**Performance Benefits of React Query**:

- **Efficient Caching**: Data is stored in memory, avoiding redundant network requests.
- **Background Updates**: Fetches only stale or invalidated data, reducing load on both the client and the server.
- **Deduplication**: Multiple components using the same query key share the same cache, avoiding duplicate fetches.
- **Automatic Garbage Collection**: Removes inactive queries after `cacheTime` to optimize memory usage.

**Redux**:

- Always keeps data in the global store, even if it's no longer needed.
- Requires manual optimization for frequent updates (e.g., throttling or debouncing actions).

React Query’s built-in optimizations make it more suitable for high-frequency updates.

<summary>13. Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) has been introduced as an abstraction for data fetching in Redux. How does RTK Query compare with React Query in terms of API design and developer experience?</summary>

**RTK Query**:

- Built into Redux Toolkit for seamless integration with Redux state.
- Uses declarative APIs (`createApi`, `useQuery`, `useMutation`) for managing server state.
- Ideal for applications already using Redux.

**React Query**:

- A standalone library focused entirely on server state management.
- Simplifies caching, background refetching, and stale data handling.
- Requires no dependency on Redux or global state.

**Comparison**:

- **RTK Query**: Better for combining client and server state in a single Redux store.
- **React Query**: Better for projects prioritizing simplicity and modular server state management.

</details>  
</br>

<details>

<summary>14. React Query has built-in support for deduplicating network requests. How would you implement a similar feature in Redux without using additional middleware?</summary>

To deduplicate network requests in Redux:

1. **Track Active Requests**:

   - Maintain an `activeRequests` state to track ongoing requests.

2. **Check Before Dispatching**:

   - Before making a request, check if it’s already being processed.

3. **Update State on Completion**:
   - Remove the request from `activeRequests` when it finishes.

**Example**:

```javascript
const activeRequests = {};

const fetchData = (key, fetchFn) => async (dispatch) => {
  if (activeRequests[key]) return; // Deduplicate request
  activeRequests[key] = true;

  try {
    const data = await fetchFn();
    dispatch({ type: "FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: data });
  } finally {
    delete activeRequests[key];
  }
};
```

This approach adds manual complexity, unlike React Query's built-in support.

<details>

<summary>15. Explain how you would handle a use case requiring both server state (React Query) and client state (Redux). Can these tools complement each other, and how?</summary>

React Query and Redux can complement each other by:

- Using **React Query** for server state (e.g., data fetching, caching, refetching).
- Using **Redux** for client state (e.g., UI preferences, local flags, and global state).

**Example**:

- Fetch server data with React Query:
  ```javascript
  const { data } = useQuery("todos", fetchTodos);
  ```
- Store UI state in Redux:
  ```javascript
  const uiState = useSelector((state) => state.ui);
  ```

These tools work well together by keeping their responsibilities separate.

</details>  
</br>

<details>

<summary>16. Discuss how React Query simplifies error handling, retries, and loading states compared to Redux. What are the trade-offs of React Query's declarative approach?</summary>

**Simplifications in React Query**:

- **Error Handling**: Built-in access to error objects (`error` state).
- **Retries**: Automatic retries configurable via the `retry` option.
- **Loading States**: Exposes `isLoading`, `isError`, and `isSuccess` states out of the box.

**Trade-offs**:

- Less control over how and when data is stored.
- Cannot persist state between sessions without additional configuration.
- Not suitable for complex client-state requirements.

</details>  
</br>

<details>

<summary>17. In a large-scale application with complex state requirements, would you recommend React Query, Redux, or a combination of both? Justify your answer with real-world scenarios.</summary>

**Recommendation**:

- Use **React Query** for managing server state efficiently with minimal boilerplate.
- Use **Redux** for managing complex client-side state like form data, UI preferences, or shared state across components.
- Combine both tools in scenarios where both server state and complex client state coexist.

**Real-World Example**:

- An e-commerce application:
  - Use **React Query** to fetch product data, cache results, and handle pagination.
  - Use **Redux** to manage the shopping cart, user preferences, and authentication state.
